- Here is the sample reply " 
<p>Query : You can't get COVID-19 if you're asymptomatic</p> 
<p>Reply:</p>p>
<p> Hello! I'm here to help you with news analysis related to monkeypox and COVID-19. If your query isn't related to either of these topics, I won't be able to assist.
Binary Class: Misinformation
Binary Explanation: Asymptomatic individuals can carry and transmit COVID-19, even if they don't experience symptoms. This is a significant factor in the spread of the virus.
Ternary Class: Misleading
Ternary Explanation: The statement is dangerously misleading as it downplays the role of asymptomatic transmission in the pandemic. This misinformation can lead to risky behaviors and increased spread.
Additional Notes: The information seems incorrect with an accuracy of 97%. COVID-19 transmission from asymptomatic individuals has been well-documented.
Additional Information: Asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is a key reason why widespread testing and preventive measures like masking and social distancing were important during the pandemic. The ability of infected individuals to spread the virus without showing symptoms makes it difficult to control the spread solely through symptomatic case isolation. Studies have shown varying rates of asymptomatic transmission, but it's consistently recognized as a substantial factor in the virus's spread. This highlights the importance of public health measures targeting the entire population, not just those displaying symptoms." </p>
